📊 Bosch Rexroth - Industrial Product Performance & Cost Analytics Dashboard


📌 Project Overview
The Bosch Rexroth Industrial Production Performance & Cost Analytics Dashboard is an interactive Power BI solution developed to analyze production efficiency, cost structure, and operational performance across departments and shifts.

The dashboard transforms 1000 production records into meaningful insights for cost optimization, efficiency improvement, and strategic manufacturing decisions.

🎯 Business Objectives

Compare planned vs actual production

Analyze production efficiency (%)

Identify department-wise cost distribution

Monitor shift-level performance

Break down cost into Raw Material, Labor, and Overhead

Track monthly and yearly production trends


📂 Dataset Description (Based on Your Actual Data)

Total Planned Cost: 354K

Total Actual Cost: 362K

Average Efficiency: 128.75

Production Variance: 7K

Total Production Count: 1000


📊 Dashboard Insights

1️⃣ Production Planning vs Actual Performance
Significant variance observed between Planned and Actual Production.

Certain records show underperformance (Efficiency below 60%).

Some cases show overproduction (Efficiency above 150%), indicating inaccurate production planning.

📌 Insight: Production forecasting and demand estimation need optimization to reduce variance.

2️⃣ Cost Structure Analysis
Raw Material Cost contributes the highest share of total production cost.

Labor and Overhead costs significantly impact total cost in high-production departments.

Departments with higher machine hours tend to show increased overhead expenses.

📌 Insight: Controlling raw material procurement and machine utilization can directly reduce production cost.

3️⃣ Department-wise Efficiency
Machining department shows high production variability.

Fabrication department demonstrates moderate and consistent efficiency.

Quality Control has controlled cost but lower production contribution.

📌 Insight: Department-level monitoring improves accountability and operational efficiency.

4️⃣ Shift-wise Performance
Night Shift records higher production efficiency in multiple instances.

Morning Shift shows balanced production output.

Evening Shift displays performance fluctuation.

📌 Insight: Shift-based productivity analysis helps optimize workforce allocation.

5️⃣ Monthly Production Trend
Production cost shows stable growth across months.

Certain months display peak production activity.

Slight dip observed towards year-end in some cases.

📌 Insight: Identifying seasonal production trends supports better capacity planning.

6️⃣ Machine Utilization Impact
Higher machine usage hours do not always result in higher efficiency.

Inefficient machine utilization increases overhead cost.

📌 Insight: Monitoring machine hours vs output ratio helps improve operational productivity.

7️⃣ Overall Operational Efficiency
Average production efficiency indicates room for optimization.

Variance between planned and actual production highlights planning gaps.

📌 Insight: Data-driven monitoring improves forecasting accuracy and cost control.
